        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
        <hr/>

        <span>Q: Where are you from?</span>
        <p>
            I am a student from Skopje, Macedonia. Yes, Macedonia, that is interesting because there are only two students
            from Macedonia at UCLA. I lived in the municipality Aerodrom, which used to be the old airport before the
            international one was developed.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <span>Q: What is a memorable place you have visited?</span>
        <p>
            I have recently visited Australia, and stayed in Melborune
            for 4 weeks, and 2 weeks in Sydney. I reconnected with part of my family that I had never met, but it was
            a really great experience. I went during the winter months, but it is Australia, it is not that cold anyway. I was like a break from the all year warm weather in Los Angeles.

        <span>Q: What are your career interests?</span>
        <p>
            I had always wanted to do something with computer science since I have been in this field for such a long time. I started coding in early middle school because I had to give up gaming due to the slow internet in my country, and I could not stay competitive. 
            <br/>
            So I wanted to become a Software Engineer. That was all great untill a year ago since ChatGPT came out, and I started to get the feeling that Software Engineering will not be around for much longer, or maybe it will, we do not know. 
            <br/>
            Considering this, I am eager to go to Graduate School right now to become an expert in a field or maybe become an expert in Artificial Inteligence too. Still have not decided.
            Here are some countries I am considering for Graduate School: Green ones are main choices!

        <span>Q: About a project you are working on, or have worked on.</span>
        <p>
            I have been working on an app that helps Dogwalkers take their clients off explitative apps like Wag! and Rover that take up to 40% of their hard earned earnings. In my view, that is very unfair and totally stacked against the worker.
            <br />
            My idea is to offer all the required features to be able for the dog walkers to take their clients off the exploitative apps to my app, and not lose anything in convenience. They will be able to keep all their earnings. The app would be a monthly subscription compared to a per walk charge on the other apps.
